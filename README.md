# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dalton Thompson

## ðŸŒ± I love to learn, and currently am learning ...

- JavaScript + Node + Electron (used in my on-going [Dota Scouter project](https://github.com/DaltonThompson/DotaScouter "Dota Scouter, an Electron app for reviewing the game history of Dota 2 players.")),  
- HTML (there are a lot of tags which most people don't realize exist),  
- CSS + Sass, and
- Git

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in also learning...

- more about CI/CD to become more comfortable around production,  
- TypeScript for bug prevention,  
- React to speed up HTML+JS development, and  
- maybe even Python to start fiddling with machine learning

## ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
