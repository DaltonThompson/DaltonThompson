# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dalton Thompson, a web developer

Check out my ongoing personal project, [Dota Scouter](https://github.com/DaltonThompson/DotaScouter "Dota Scouter, an app for scouting the game history of Dota 2 players and valuing potential decisions in the draft phase."). Although it is designed to be familiar for a specific audience, I hope its easy to understand.

I regularly use JavaScript, CSS/Sass, and HTML. I've dabbled in Node, Electron, and React, although I decided to limit myself to vanilla JS to better understand fundamentals which can be abstracted away by some popular frameworks. Consider it "walking before running." Regardless, Iâ€™m still interested in refactoring my projects with TypeScript & React.
